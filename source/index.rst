Unix for Astronomers
=====================

These are the course notes for the **Basic and Advanced Unix** sessions of the
`2013 ASA/ANITA Astroinformatics Summer School
<http://www.smp.uq.edu.au/anitaworkshop2013/?page_id=30>`_.

For an idea of what is included in each of the **basic** and **advanced**
sections, see the contents listings below.  A pdf version of this tutorial can
be found `here <_static/unix_tutorial.pdf>`_.

These notes are a shameless (in some places barely altered) reworking of the
`Unix Tutorial <http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/>`_ by M. Stonebank
(2001; The University of Surrey).
