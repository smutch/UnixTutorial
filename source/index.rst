Unix for Astronomers
=====================

These are the course notes for the **Basic and advanced Unix** section of the `2013 ASA/ANITA Astroinformatics Summer School <http://www.smp.uq.edu.au/anitaworkshop2013/?page_id=30>`_.

These notes are a shameless (barely altered) reworking of the excellent `Unix Tutorial <http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/>`_ by M. Stonebank (2001; The University of Surrey).
