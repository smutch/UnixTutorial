Unix for Astronomers
=====================

These are the course notes for the **Basic and Advanced Unix** sessions of the `2013 ASA/ANITA Astroinformatics Summer School <http://www.smp.uq.edu.au/anitaworkshop2013/?page_id=30>`_.

The **Basic Unix** session covers the very basics of Unix and the command
line, and is targeted at beginners or those only previously familiar with
Windows systems. We will look some of the following topics:

- navigating the file system
- creating, editing and displaying files
- pipes and IO redirection
- some useful Unix commands
- getting help and suggestions

These notes are a shameless (in some places barely altered) reworking of the `Unix Tutorial <http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/>`_ by M. Stonebank (2001; The University of Surrey).
